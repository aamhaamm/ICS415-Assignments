# Project 1 â€“ Implement a Ray Tracer

This project demonstrates a basic ray tracing implementation. It renders multiple colored spheres with reflections on a reflective plane

## Task Description

The goal is to:

1. **Implement ray-sphere intersections** and basic shading.
2. **Render multiple colored spheres** arranged in a 3D scene.
3. **Add reflections** for realistic surface effects.
4. **Output image** showcasing the rendered scene.

## Features

- **Sphere intersection** calculations for precise rendering.
- **Ambient, diffuse, and specular shading** for realistic lighting.
- **Reflections** for mirror-like surfaces.
- **Configurable scene**: Adjust the number of spheres, colors, etc.
- **Outputs** image with the final result.
