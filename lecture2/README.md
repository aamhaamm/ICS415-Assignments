# Lecture 2 - Shading and Lighting

This project builds upon the basic ray tracing concepts from Lecture 1 by adding shading and lighting effects to create a more realistic 3D scene.

## Task Description

The goal is to:

1. Extend the ray tracer to include lighting and shading effects.
2. Implement the following types of lighting:
   - Ambient lighting.
   - Diffuse reflection.
   - Specular reflection.
3. Generate an image (`Lecture2.png`) showcasing the rendered spheres with realistic lighting and shading.

## Features

- Ray-sphere intersection.
- Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting effects.
- Support for multiple light sources (ambient, point, and directional lights).
- Outputs a PNG image with realistic shading.
