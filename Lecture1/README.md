# Lecture 1 - Basic Ray Tracing

This project demonstrates basic ray tracing concepts by rendering spheres in 3D space.

## Task Description

The goal is to:

1. Set up a development environment for raw pixel graphics.
2. Implement ray tracing to render spheres as described in Chapter 2 of the course material.
3. Generate an image (`Lecture1.png`) showing the rendered spheres.

## Features

- Basic ray-sphere intersection.
- Simple color rendering.
- Outputs a PNG image.
