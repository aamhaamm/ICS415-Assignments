# Lecture 5 - Ray Traced Scene with Cylinder, Sphere, and Stanford Bunny

This project expands on ray tracing techniques by rendering a scene containing a **cylinder**, a **sphere**, and the **Stanford Bunny** using reflection, refraction, and transparency.

## Task Description

The goal is to:

1. **Implement ray tracing for a mathematically defined cylinder** and compute its intersection with rays.
2. **Render a scene** containing:
   - A **dark blue semi-transparent cylinder.**
   - A **shiny red reflective sphere.**
   - A **white Stanford Bunny.**
3. **Apply realistic shading** including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
4. **Compute shadows** cast by the objects.
5. **Implement reflection and refraction** for realistic material rendering.
6. **Optimize performance** by minimizing unnecessary calculations.

## Features

- **Mathematically defined cylinder** with accurate ray intersection calculations.
- **Stanford Bunny triangle mesh** rendering.
- **Sphere rendering with reflection and shading.**
- **Flat and Phong shading techniques** for realistic lighting.
- **Reflection and refraction** to simulate transparency and reflectivity.
- **Shadows computation** for realistic occlusion.
- **Bounding box optimization** for ray-triangle intersection tests.
